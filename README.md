# Kernal_vs_Neural_Networks
Implementation and comparison between two kernel models and a neural network model in binary classification task on a partial dataset from MNIST using PyTorch.

# Introduction
In this assignment, I applied two kernel models and a neural network model to the binary classification task on a partial dataset from MNIST. In this classification task, the model takes a 16x16 image of handwritten digits as inputs and classify the image into two classes. For each data sample, the dictionary key x indicates its raw features, which are represented by a 256-dimensional vector where the values between [ 1; 1] indicate grayscale pixel values for a 16x16 image. In addition, the key y is the label for a data example, which can be 0, 1 or 2.
